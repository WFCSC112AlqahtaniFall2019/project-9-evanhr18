Bubble Sort has a worst-case and average complexity of O(n^2).
This is more way more complex than most other sorting algorithms, which causes Bubble Sort to take considerably longer in sorting bigger lists.
However, even other sorting algorithms with similar complexity, such as insertion sort, tend to run much faster than Bubble Sort, meaning that Bubble Sort is not a practical sorting algorithm.
The advantage of bubble sort, however, is that in the best case scenario, when the list is already sorted, it has a complexity of O(n), while other algorithms will continue to go through their entire algorithms regardless of if the list is already sorted or not.
Generally, avoid bubble sort when dealing with large sets of data.

Selection Sort also has a complexity of O(n^2).
This means that, like bubble sort, selection sort is not a great algorithm to use for large sets of data.
Also similarly, selection sort takes longer to run than insertion sort, another algorithm with O9n^2) complexity.
Selection sort is helpful though because it is an extremely simple algorithm and can be advantageous to use when memory is limited.
